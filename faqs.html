<li><a id="unique-identifier1"></a> How can I find out if there are any current issues that might affect users?
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.LearnSoci.al/support">www.LearnSoci.al/support</a></p></li>

<li>Audio
<ul>
<li><a id="unique-identifier2"></a> Audio recording is not working in the native browser/Safari.
<p>This is in the process of being fixed, but in the meantime, you can record your voice in a separate application (e.g. Android phone: Voice Recorder app; iPhone: Voice Memos app).</p>
<p>In some situations the audio playback within the browser doesn’t work. However, if you submit the activity to your study group it will upload successfully.</p>
<p>In the iPhone/iPad you may be directed to a video-recording app to capture audio. The platform will only take the audio data from the file recorded with the video application. </p>
</li>

<li><a id="unique-identifier3"></a> Why is audio recording/playback broken-up?

<p>If this happens, use a desktop computer/laptop for audio activities or deny the browser’s access to the microphone and upload a recording made from a separate voice recording application.</p>
<p>Smartphones/tablets should be OK if they are using Android version 4 & above or iPhones/iPads using iOS 6 & above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Downloading
<ul>
<li><a id="unique-identifier4"></a> How can I download units for offline use ...?
<p>On the Units menu, just click the black download cloud on the right-hand side of the unit that you require. If there is no black cloud icon next to the unit menu, the offline function is not supported by your device. </p></li>
<li><a id="uni
que-identifier5"></a> Download for offline - I can only download one unit at a time.
<p>The ‘download for offline use’ function is designed to be used to download just one or two units at a time. However, if you need to download a higher number of units you will need to increase your browser’s offline cache size.</p></li>
<p>Some browsers have a limitation on the amount of data that can be stored on them. Chrome and Firefox do not have any limitation on data storage. </p><li><a id="unique-identifier6"></a> How to increase your browser's cache size.
</li>
<li><a id="unique-identifier7"></a> I have downloaded a unit to use offline. However, none of the images load. Why?
<p>Unfortunately this is  due to the phone/tablet being used. It is caused by a lack of processing power in the phone/tablet.  Smartphones/tablets should be OK if they are using Android version 4 & above or iPhones/iPads using iOS 6 & above.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Social Exercises
<ul>
<li><a id="unique-identifier8"></a> Why can't I see Social Exercises by another student as soon as they are submitted?
<p>Sometimes it will take a little while to display exercises or reviews after they are submitted, if they do not display after 1 hour please email support@learnsoci.al.</p></li>
<li><a id="unique-identifier9"></a> How do I delete a Social Exercise that I submitted by mistake to the Group / Teacher?
<p>You cannot delete a social exercise that you have already submitted, but you can always submit another attempt at the same question. It is a good idea not to be too precious about the exercises that you submit, the more activities you submit, the faster you will improve your English skills. </p></li>
<li><a id="unique-identifier10"></a> How do I find a friend in a Review List?
<p>Just scroll through the answers. You can choose to view 5, 10, 15 or 20 answers per page. 
You can also use the browser’s ‘Find’ function to search for your friend’s name if there are lots of reviews on a page. You can do this on a PC by pressing Ctrl+F and type their name, or by using the Search button in a browser on a phone/tablet.
</p></li>
<li><a id="unique-identifier11"></a> Why can’t I see a Group just created by my Teacher in my Group list?
<p>After selecting the Group icon, you have to use the “Search Groups” button on the left to get a list of Groups.</p>
<p>If you had the “Search Groups” list open while your Teacher was creating the new Group, you will need to move briefly to another part of the platform to allow the new Group name to be loaded into the list. For example, just select one of the 3 main icons: “Home” or “Courses” or “My Scores”, then select the “Group” icon again.
</p></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Scores
<ul>
<li><a id="unique-identifier12"></a> Why do my scores for an exercise appear more than once?
<p>This is so that the progress that you have made when repeating the exercise can be seen.
From August you will be able to filter the scores to see only your highest score for each exercise.
</p></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Settings
<ul>
<li><a id="unique-identifier13"></a> How do I change my screen name?
<p>It is not possible to change your screen name at the moment, you have to delete your account and create a new account. (This requires a new Access Code from your teacher, also known as a Registration Code or Redemption Code.)</p></li>
<li><a id="unique-identifier14"></a> What will happen if I do not select “allow local storage” when I first try the platform?
<p>The platform LearnSoci.al needs to use a part of your browser  called “local storage” to reduce the amount of times that you need to connect to the platform over the internet. This makes the platform much faster to use than other e-learning websites. 
If you do not select “allow local storage” you will not be able to access the platform.
