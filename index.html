				<h1>Make Learning Social</h1>

<p><i>"We can practice all skills and it is
‘sample units available on request’
useful to have feedback from classmates"</i><br/><b>Ming-Fang</b></p>

<p><b>Peer review</b> is a key feature of social learning. Regular exercises encourage learners to submit their work for review by other members of their class or study group. </p>
<p>Students are familiar with sharing images, audio and messages online with each other. The unique Social Learning online platform facilitates this in a way which is 
carefully integrated with learning goals.</p>

<!--<p>The teacher gives feedback on all the social exercises submitted and gives the final grade. Therefore, <b>each language production exercise is validated</b> after the peer review stage.
The classmates’ contributions can be checked and the students’ progress tracked.</p>-->
				
				<!--<p>Social learning theory is a perspective that states that people learn within a social context. It is facilitated through concepts such as modeling and observational learning.</p>
<p><ul>
<li>People learn from the environment and seek acceptance from society by learning through influential models.¹</li>
<li>Social learning theory is a perspective that states that social behavior (any type of behavior that we display socially) is learned primarily by observing and imitating the actions of others.²</li>
<li>Social learning behavior is also influenced by being rewarded for these actions.
Our platform implements these concepts based on the founders experience and knowledge gained with Cambridge University.</li>
